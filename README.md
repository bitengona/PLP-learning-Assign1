1.	Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is to develop and maintain software systems; software development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
2.	Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1960s-1970s:Before structured programming, software development was often characterized by "spaghetti code," which was difficult to understand and maintain. The focus was more on writing code that worked rather than code that was clean and organized.
introduction of structured programming was pivotal. Key figures like Edsger Dijkstra and Donald Knuth advocated for structured programming principles. Dijkstra’s famous letter "Go To Statement Considered Harmful" (1968) argued against the use of the "goto" statement and promoted structured control flow constructs like loops and conditionals.; improving code clarity, modularity, and maintainability. It laid the foundation for more sophisticated programming paradigms and better software development practices.
1980s: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The release of languages like Smalltalk in the 1980s, and later C++, demonstrated the practical benefits of OOP. Impact: OOP became a dominant paradigm in software engineering, influencing many modern programming languages and development practices. It provided a more intuitive approach to software design, enabling better management of large codebases and fostering the creation of reusable and extensible software components.
2000s: Introduction of Agile methodologies as a set of principles emphasizing iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility. They transformed how software development teams approach projects, focusing on delivering incremental value, embracing change, and fostering better communication between developers and stakeholders. 
3.	List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle
Requirements Gathering and Analysis: This is to understand and document the needs and requirements of the stakeholders and users. It involves conducting interviews, surveys and workshops; analyzing existing systems.
System Design: Creating a detailed plan for how the software will be constructed based on the requirements above. This includes both architecture and detailed design (specific components and interfaces). It results in design Specifications Document, including architectural diagrams, interface designs, and data models.
Implementation (or Coding): Translating the design specifications into actual code; involves writing and compiling the software components and integrating them into a working system. It results in a Source code, executable files, and initial unit tests.
Testing: Verifying and validating that the software works as intended and meets the specified requirements. This phase involves identifying and fixing defects and ensuring the software is reliable, secure, and performs well.
Deployment: Releasing the software to the end-users. It involves preparing for and managing the rollout of the software. There’s Installing the software, training the users, and offering initial support e.g with user training materials.
Maintenance and Support: Ensuring the software continues to function correctly and meets users' needs over time. This phase involves fixing bugs, making improvements, and adapting to changing requirements.

4.	Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology: It’s Linear and Sequential, it’s a traditional, linear approach where each phase of the project must be completed before the next phase begins. Emphasis is placed on thorough documentation at each stage. Since all requirements are defined upfront, it’s easier to predict timelines and costs.
Appropriate scenario: Construction Projects: In fields like construction or manufacturing, where detailed upfront planning and sequential phases are standard.
Agile Methodology: Iterative and Incremental, it emphasizes iterative progress through small, manageable increments called sprints or iterations. The project evolves through continuous feedback and adaptation.
Appropriate Scenarios: Product Development: When developing products where user feedback is crucial and adjustments need to be made based on that feedback, such as mobile apps or web platforms.

5.	Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Design and Development: Create and implement software applications or systems according to the project requirements.

6.	Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Efficiency and Productivity: IDEs streamline the coding process by integrating multiple tools and features into a single interface. Example: Visual Studio Code: An  IDE that supports a wide range of programming languages through extensions.
Code Assistance: help developers write code more quickly and with fewer mistakes e.g Version Tracking: VCS track changes to code over time, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed. This is crucial for managing and maintaining a codebase.
Debugging Tools: these allow developers to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through code e.g IntelliJ IDEA: is popular among Java developers but also supports other languages. It integrates with build tools and has robust debugging capabilities.
Project Management: IDEs offer project management features such as file navigation, build automation, and task management, which help in organizing and managing codebases.
Integration with Other Tools: Many IDEs can integrate with build systems, testing frameworks, and VCS, providing a unified development experience. E.g Eclipse: An open-source IDE primarily used for Java development but also supports other languages through plugins. It offers extensive tools for code development, debugging, and testing. 
Backup and Recovery: By maintaining a history of changes, VCS provides a backup mechanism. If something goes wrong, developers can recover earlier versions of the code.
Change Documentation: VCS often requires commit messages, which document the purpose of changes. This provides context and rationale for code modifications, aiding in understanding and future maintenance.

Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
9.	Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
It’s the practice of designing and refining prompts or inputs to interact effectively with AI models, particularly language models like GPT-4. It involves crafting the queries or commands you provide to the model to get the most accurate, relevant, and useful responses.
Importance:
Enhanced Accuracy: Well-engineered prompts lead to more accurate and relevant answers. By being precise, users can avoid misinterpretation and get responses that are more aligned with their needs.
Efficiency: Effective prompts can save time by reducing the need for follow-up questions or clarifications. 
Better User Experience: Clear and well-structured prompts enable a smoother interaction with AI
Maximizing Model Potential: Helps in unlocking the full potential of these models by guiding them in a direction that produces valuable results.
Reducing Errors and Misunderstandings that can arise from vague or poorly structured queries.
Facilitating Creativity and Exploration: Well-crafted prompts can inspire more imaginative or insightful outputs, pushing the boundaries of what the AI can produce.

10.	Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: “Tell me about Cancer.”
Improved Prompt: “Explain the impact of Cancer in the Kenyan population in the past five years.”
Explanation: The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the subject (Cancer), the context (Kenyan population), and the time frame (past five years). This clarity helps the respondent focus their answer on relevant details and provides a clear direction for their response, resulting in a more precise and useful answer.
